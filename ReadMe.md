# Flipper Application Files (FAPs) for Any Firmware with API v34.x
## Apps from this pack should be compatible with OFW with API v34.x (dev branch) or any other firmware build with API 34.x

## [Download all files by using this link, and copy only apps folder onto your microSD](https://download-directory.github.io/?url=https://github.com/xMasterX/all-the-plugins/tree/main/apps) (does not include [bundled apps](https://github.com/DarkFlippers/unleashed-firmware#community-apps-included))


---

Apps contains changes needed to compile them on latest firmware, fixes has been done by @xMasterX

I have decided to not include the "integrated/bundled" FAP files that come with a fresh install of Unleashed. If you need to grab a copy of them for whatever reason, you can do so right from the Unleashed repo.

Sources of "integrated/bundled" apps are added now in this repo too, to allow publishing them in the official catalog :)

* Visit the [Releases page](https://github.com/DarkFlippers/unleashed-firmware) of the Unleashed repo.
* Scroll down and download the linked ZIP file from the Assets drop down, under the big install from web link.
* Within that ZIP, you'll find `resources.tar` - open/extract that too and look in the `apps` folder.

## Thank you to the authors!

The Flipper and its community wouldn't be as rich as it is without your contributions and support. Thank you for all you have done.
